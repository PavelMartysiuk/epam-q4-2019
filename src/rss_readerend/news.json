Most won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chnge hnds: just 70 did in 2017 with 111 doing so two yers erlier.But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ones tht do tht determine who governs.The key to interreting the results is the concet of swing -- the shift in votes from one rty to nother comred with the revious election.Click here for n interctive election mA rty needs 326 out of 650 sets for  mjority in the House of Commons though in rctice bout 320 will suffice becuse the seker nd three deuties don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote nd Northern Irelnd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sinn Fein chooses not to sit in the Westminster rliment.Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s redecessor Theres My won 317 sets two yers go. In theory it mens tht with  uniform 0.54% swing mong voters to the Conservtives from Lbour the Tories could tke the nine sets it needs from Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rty to secure  mjority. A swing of just over 3% would see Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rty tke bout 30 sets off the oosition delivering  mjority of round 40.But in relity it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s  much more comlicted clcultion becuse voter swings re not consistent ntionwide due to the resence of smller rties tcticl voting nd the blurring of suort due to Brexit. Johnson will robbly need to win sets in the north nd midlnds to offset otentil losses in ro-Euroen districts in southern Englnd nd Scotlnd where growing suort for indeendence is lso bolstering the Scottish Ntionl Prty.The olls hve consistently ointed to  Tory win though the mrgin hs nrrowed nd ccording to YouGov everything from  Tory lndslide to  hung Prliment -- where no rty holds  mjority -- remins within the mrgin of error. A smll chnge in voter mood could swing the election in either direction.Below is  list of some key results to wtch for nd when.10 .m.Voting ends nd brodcsters relese their exit oll. Lst time it redicted 314 sets for the Tories nd 266 for Lbour -- close to the finl result of 317 to 262. Once enough results re in lter in the night sehologists emloyed by TV sttions will nnounce their rojections for the finl result.11 .m.The northestern cities of Sunderlnd nd Newcstle uon Tyne with 3 sets ech re vying to be first to nnounce their results between 11 .m. nd midnight.The lst time ny Sunderlnd set returned  Tory Member of Prliment ws in 1959; Newcstle hsn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done so since 1983. If Lbour loses ny of these sets it suggests they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re set for  bd night. A swing in Brexit-suorting Sunderlnd in rticulr could oint to Tory gins lter in the night in mrginl Lbour sets tht voted to leve the Euroen Union in 2016.1 .m.With most of the erly reorting sets hving sfe mjorities the first rumblings of chnge my come now.The Tories hve trgeted  tye of voter they dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workington Mn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd defined s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 tyiclly older white non-grdute mle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from  northern town. Brexit-bcking Workington on the west cost could be the first indiction of whether Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rty hs broken through Lbour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red wll\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of sets in centrl nd northern Englnd. They need  4.7% swing to overturn  mjority of lmost 4000.North of the border there could be more Lbour misery with Rutherglen  Hmilton West exected to be the first Scottish set to declre. The Scottish Ntionl Prty re trgeting Lbour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 265-vote mjority.1:30 .m.Drlington -- 35th on the Tory trget list of Lbour-held sets -- is due to nnounce. If Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rty cn overturn Lbour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3280-vote mjority on  3.7% swing  60-set mjority could be on the crds.2 .m.The ce icks u with more thn 75 results exected.

None hs ever voted Conservtive but olls suggest they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in ly.Hrtleool is one of the stronger sets for Nigel Frge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brexit Prty though olls suggest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely to win. In Lnrk  Hmilton Est just 360 votes serted the winning SNP from the Tories nd Lbour lst time.Btterse nd Putney should rovide insight into how Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ro-Brexit messge is fring in Remin-bcking London sets.3 .m.Results will be coming in t bout six er minute by now. If the Tories re on  roll they could tke Sedgefield -- former Lbour Prime Minister Tony Blir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set until 2007 -- s well s Lbour sets including Bedford Bisho Aucklnd Newcstle-under-Lyme Blckool South nd Birminghm Northfield. A win in Don Vlley Lbour-held since 1922 could be  sign the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Get Brexit Done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd slogn hs cut through -- even though Croline Flint the Lbour incumbent suorted Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s del.In North Wles  bttle in Ynys Mon between the Tories Lbour nd the Welsh ntionlists Plid Cymru could go the ruling rty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wy for the first time since 1983 while Alyn  Deeside nd Delyn re lso in Conservtive sights.But if Lbour re confounding execttions -- s they did two yers go -- they could ick u Bolton West nd Norwich North from the Tories. Holding Peterborough which voted 63% to leve the EU would suggest Lbour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ln to hold  second referendum hsn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dmged its rosects. A big scl could come in London where Lbour re mounting  strong chllenge to former Tory leder nd rominent Brexiteer Iin Duncn Smith in Chingford  Woodford Green.A Lbour revivl lso requires icking u sets in Scotlnd its former stronghold.

    "These ntics my work s  short-term strtegy. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll go down oorly with voters the Reublicn rty relly needs  House Democrts nnounced this week tht they would bring two rticles of imechment ginst Donld Trum mking him only the fourth resident in US history to fce such chrges. Democrtic leders chrcterized the occsion s solemn somber nd sd. Reublicns on the other hnd dismissed the imechment inquiry s  circus nd  shm desite the fct tht they re themselves the ones trying to reduce it to crnivlesque frce. Even  motion to tke  15-minute bthroom brek during this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judiciry committee herings rovoked hystericl Reublicn objections.The Reublicn strtegy clerly is to undermine nd delegitimize the imechment inquiry. Reublicns re ortrying the inquiry s  hox nd n ttemted cou by Democrts deserte to reverse the results of the 2016 election unrelted to ny ctul residentil wrongdoing. The White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusl to cooerte with Congress by sending legl reresenttion to the imechment herings ws exlined by Trum counselor Kellynne Conwy s resistnce to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colluding with n illegitimte rocess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.Why re Reublicns tking this roch? Lrgely becuse they hve no other choice given the considerble weight of evidence tht the resident did in fct buse his ower nd obstruct Congress s chrged in the imechment rticles.The oet Crl Sndburg is credited with sying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the fcts re ginst you rgue the lw. If the lw is ginst you rgue the fcts. If the lw nd the fcts re ginst you ound the tble nd yell like hell.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reublicn yelling nd tble-ounding er to be hving the desired result s most olls find tht ublic suort for imechment hs leveled off since October. Intense rtisn triblism nd the influence of rightwing medi outlets such s Fox News men tht few Reublicns or even indeendents will robbly chnge their minds bout imechment no mtter wht evidence comes out of further herings.In the short term then the Reublicn strtegy of stonewlling nd counter-ccustions my y off. The votes on imechment in the House nd removl in the Sente will lmost certinly brek long uniform rty lines mking it esier for Reublicns to ortry the rocess s driven entirely by rtisnshi. Reublicn voters outrged by imechment my be more motivted to vote in 2020 while some indeendents my be so turned off by the whole sectcle tht they either vote for Trum or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote t ll.In the longer term however the Reublicn roch to imechment will robbly rove counterroductive. The rty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticl wekness s reveled by the 2018 midterm elections is tht it hs lost the suort of the college-educted nd mostly suburbn voters (esecilly women) who once used to relibly vote Reublicn. By ttemting to sbotge the imechment rocess nd refusing to ddress the substnce of Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ctions the Reublicn rty will further dmge its imge with these voters nd mke it even hrder to regin  governing mjority.There re mny exlntions for why college-educted suburbn voters hve turned ginst the Reublicn rty; under Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ledershi for exmle the rty hs incresingly become the vehicle of white working-clss resentments. But my interctions with college-educted suburbn voters in the course of trying to figure out why they hve bndoned the Reublicn rty hve led me to believe tht they tend to cre bout fcts nd rtionl rgument to view our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to civil servnts s serious rofessionls rther thn nefrious gents of the dee stte nd to refer tht Congress solve roblems rther thn devolve further into chos nd dysfunction. They re more likely to be lrmed thn ersuded when Trum nd other Reublicn officils serve s conduits for Russin rognd by souting bseless consircy theories lleging tht Ukrine rther thn Russi interfered in the 2016 US elections. And they worry bout Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trmling of democrtic norms nd constitutionl boundries on executive ower. The rty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticl wekness ... is tht it hs lost the suort of the college-educted nd mostly suburbn votersFor ll these resons Reublicns in Congress by turning the imechment crisis into  circus re likely to further liente the swing voters who cost the rty control of the House in 2018 (nd my derive it of Sente control in 2020). When those of us who wnt the Reublicn rty to el to  wider demogrhic clled for it to become  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big tent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rty this wsn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wht we hd in mind.A glimmer of wht could hve been  better Reublicn roch to the imechment inquiry ered recently in the judiciry committee testimony of the George Wshington University lw rofessor Jonthn Turley who ws the sole legl exert clled by Reublicns. Turley (who did not vote for Trum) conceded tht Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hone cll to the Ukrinin resident \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ws nything but erfect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but rgued tht the Democrts were ursuing imechment too quickly nd with insufficient evidence comred with the roceedings ginst residents Nixon nd Clinton. Turley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clim tht Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ctions did not mount to imechble crimes is highly debtble but his testimony ws notble recisely becuse he ws the sole seker on the Reublicn side clling for resoned debte.Recently the Reublicn congressmn Frncis Rooney of Florid demnded tht severl members of Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dministrtion with direct knowledge of the resident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s orders on Ukrine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the secretry of stte Mike Pomeo; the cting White House chief of stff Mick Mulvney; nd Trum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ttorney Rudy Giulini \u00e2\u20ac\u201c testify in the imechment herings.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Firsthnd ccounts like these\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rooney sid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would ffirm tht the imechment rocess is seeking substntive outcomes bsed on rel fcts nd ccurte informtion rther thn reflecting  more oliticl objective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdDemocrts will robbly dismiss this s more unnecessry foot-drgging but even the Democrtic-lening Wshington Post hs editorilized tht  lengthier rocess \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my be justified if it results in testimony from dministrtion witnesses. This lso might convince more Americns tht the imechment rocess hs been conducted thoroughly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdBut Rooney (who will retire t the end of this term) is n isolted voice on the Reublicn side nd lredy he hs fced furious criticism from Trumin loylists for declining to stte whether he is for or ginst imechment until he hs seen more evidence.Reublicns er locked into their strtegy of trying to dismiss imechment s  rtisn shm desite the likelihood tht this will mke it hrder to win bck college-educted suburbn swing voters. In hindsight Reublicns my come to feel tht this ly for short-term oliticl dvntge cme t too high  cost.  * Geoffrey Kbservice is the director of oliticl studies t the Nisknen Center in Wshington DC s well s the uthor of Rule nd Ruin: The Downfll of Modertion nd the Destruction of the Reublicn Prty",
